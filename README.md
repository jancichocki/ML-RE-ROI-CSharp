# Real Estate ROI Prediction using Machine Learning
Description
This repository contains code to predict the Return on Investment (ROI) for real estate properties using machine learning algorithms. Specifically, the code is written in C# and uses the Microsoft ML.NET library.

The repository consists of two main C# files:

RealEstateData.cs - This file defines the data model for the real estate properties, including various features like location score, square footage, age of the property, and so on.

Program.cs - This file contains the main program where the machine learning pipeline is defined, the model is trained, and predictions are made.

Features
The following features are used for the prediction:

Location Score
Square Footage
Age of Property
Vacancy Rate
Market Growth
Interest Rate
Property Tax
Operating Expenses
Net Operating Income
Price
The target variable for prediction is ROI (Return on Investment).

How to Run
Clone this repository.
Open the solution in your preferred IDE for C# (e.g., Visual Studio).
Make sure the ML.NET NuGet package is installed.
Run the program.
Output
The output will be the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model on the test set, which gives you an idea of how well the model is performing.
