Real Estate ROI Prediction using Machine Learning
Description
This repository contains code to predict the Return on Investment (ROI) for real estate properties using machine learning algorithms. The code is written in C# and leverages the Microsoft ML.NET library.

Repository Structure 📂
RealEstateData.cs: Defines the data model for the real estate properties, including various features like location score, square footage, age of the property, and so on.

Program.cs: Contains the main program where the machine learning pipeline is defined, the model is trained, and predictions are made.

Features 🛠
The following features are used for the prediction:

Location Score
Square Footage
Age of Property
Vacancy Rate
Market Growth
Interest Rate
Property Tax
Operating Expenses
Net Operating Income
Price
